# call-stats
Discord bot that monitors voice channels and provides a summary of the activity.

I created this bot to observe voice activity over a voice channel and provide users with interesting statistics about the call. This bot was created with the discord.py library which provides useful decorators and functions that allow you to communicate with discord servers. With this backbone, IÂ used Plotly, a python graphing library, to create an interesting visualization of the collected statistics.

# Usage

First, create a bot through discord's developer portal and then put its token into a token.txt file in the same directory.

Then, just add the bot to your server and run the python file.
